{"name":"climdex.pcic.ncdf","tagline":"R package to compute Climdex indices on gridded NetCDF files","body":"# What is climdex.pcic.ncdf?\r\n\r\n* `climdex.pcic.ncdf` is a companion library for `climdex.pcic` which helps in using NetCDF input grids and writing to NetCDF output files when computing the [27 core indices of extreme climate](http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml). The code allows for parallel computation of indices using either a SOCK or MPI cluster. It was written for the [R statistical programming language](http://www.r-project.org/) by the [Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium](http://pacificclimate.org/).\r\n\r\n# Getting Help\r\n\r\n## New to programming or to R?\r\n\r\n* Read the the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/index.html)  [Programming in R](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/r/index.html) lessons\r\n* Read one of the man [R Manuals](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).\r\n* Attend an [R Users Group](http://r-users-group.meetup.com/) meeting.\r\n\r\n## Looking for code?\r\n\r\n* Get the latest [climdex.pcic.ncdf release from our website](http://www.pacificclimate.org/~bronaugh/climdex.pcic.ncdf_0.5-4.tar.gz).\r\n* Explore the [development repository](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/).\r\n\r\n## Need help using the package?\r\n\r\n* Read the manual\r\n```R\r\n    > library(climdex.pcic.ncdf)\r\n    Loading required package: PCICt\r\n    > ?climdex.pcic.ncdf\r\n```\r\n* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/issues/new) on the [package issue tracker](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/issues) and label it \"help wanted\"[1].\r\n\r\n## Want to contribute?\r\n\r\n* To report a bug in pcic.climdex use the [package issue tracker](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/issues) (after you've read the [bug reporting guide](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#bug-reports)).\r\n* To help with development read through the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climdex.pcic.ncdf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n\r\n## Still need help?\r\n\r\n* Contact climate@uvic.ca and let us know what we can do.\r\n\r\n[1] Please know that the pool of people who can provide support for the package is extremely small and time is limited.  We don't necessarily have the capacity for long, open-ended user support.
